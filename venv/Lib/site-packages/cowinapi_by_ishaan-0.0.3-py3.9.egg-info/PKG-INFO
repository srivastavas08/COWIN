# Cowin Vaccine Tracker 

Python API wrapper for vaccine availability by Pincode, DistrictId for 1 week and get detailed list of all states, Districts. 

India's digital platform launched by the govt. to help citizens register themselves for the vaccination drive by booking an appointment at the nearby available vaccination centres.

The process to search for available slots to take the vaccine is tedious as you need to log in to the portal every time.

This wrapper API enables folks to build their own versions of a system to lookup for vaccine availablity either in a district or in a particular pin code.


## Example:

```python
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData

cowin = FetchData()

states = cowin.get_states_table()
print(states)
```

## Installation
```pip install cowinapi_by_ishaan```

## Usage

This wrapper currently covers nine endpoints used by the CoWin portal specified below.

## Initialize

```python
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData

cowin = FetchData()
```

### Get All States In Tabular Form
```python
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData

cowin = FetchData()

states = cowin.get_states_table()
print(states)
```

### Get All States In List Form
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData

cowin = FetchData()

states = cowin.get_states_list()
print(states)
```

### Get All States In Dictionary Form
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData

cowin = FetchData()

states = cowin.get_states_dict()
print(states)
```

### Get All Districts In Tabular Form
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
cowin = FetchData()

districts = cowin.get_districts_tables()
print(districts)
```

### Get All Districts In List Form

from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
cowin = FetchData()

districts = cowin.get_districts_list()
print(districts)
```

### Get All Districts In Dictionary Form
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
cowin = FetchData()

districts = cowin.get_districts_dict()
print(districts)
```

### Detailed Availability By Pincode for a week
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
pin_code = "110001"

cowin = FetchData()
#pass number of days in method to get data for next specified days or 7 days is taken as default
available_centers = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(pin_code)
print(available_centers)
available_centers_by_days = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(pin_code,5)
print(available_centers_by_days)
```

### Detailed Availability By DistrictID for a week
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
district_id  = "394"

cowin = FetchData()
#pass number of days in method to get data for next specified days or 7 days is taken as default
available_centers = cowin.get_centers_by_districtId(district_id)
print(available_centers)
available_centers_by_days = cowin.get_centers_by_districtId(district_id,5)
print(available_centers_by_days)
```

### Simple Availability By Pincode for a week
```python 
from cowinapi_by_ishaan import FetchData
pin_code = "110001"

cowin = FetchData()
#pass number of days in method to get data for next specified days or 7 days is taken as default
available_centers = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(pin_code)
print(available_centers)
available_centers_by_days = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(pin_code,5)
print(available_centers_by_days)
```

The CoWIn API's sometimes return a 401 Unauthorized response. Please wait for a few minutes before trying again.

Please try not to spam the CoWin servers and try to keep a timeout between subsequent requests if you are polling at a fixed interval
